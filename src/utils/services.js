/**
 * Site services — where a site's search, form submissions, assistant, or
 * anything else of that shape actually go.
 *
 * ## The one idea
 *
 * A component must never name a host. Whether this site's search is answered by
 * a prebuilt index, a server endpoint, or a vendor API is a *deployment* fact,
 * and a foundation that hardcodes it is coupled to one deployment. So the
 * address comes from configuration, and there are exactly two places it can
 * come from:
 *
 *   1. **The site**, authored — `search:`, `submit:`, `assistant:` in site.yml.
 *      The operator's own declaration, and it wins.
 *   2. **The host**, served — `config.services.<name>` in the payload. What the
 *      deployment offers, which the site never had to know about.
 *
 * Absent from both means the site has no such service, and the component renders
 * for that rather than guessing an address. That is the same rule for every service, and
 * it is why this module exists: it was previously implemented three times — the
 * search provider, the submit resolver, and a hand-rolled copy inside a
 * foundation — with three slightly different base-joining rules between them.
 *
 * ## The registry is open, not an enum
 *
 * `resolveService(website, name)` takes a *name*, and the framework has no list
 * of permitted ones. It ships **clients** only for what it already implements
 * (search, form submission); it ships **resolution** for anything. A foundation
 * that invents `assistant`, `booking` or `translate` gets the same precedence,
 * the same base handling and the same absent-means-absent behaviour, and a host
 * can fill the slot without a framework change.
 *
 * This is deliberate and it is the same shape as `fetcher.transports`: the
 * framework owns the seam, not the catalogue.
 *
 * ## What this deliberately does not model
 *
 * **Entitlement.** A host that will not serve a service omits it, or declares
 * the name with no address. The framework never learns why — no plan names, no
 * tiers, no "paid" anywhere. That is not squeamishness: `@uniweb/kit` is
 * public, and a framework that encodes which capabilities cost money ships the
 * business model into open source.
 *
 * ⛔ **There is deliberately no explanatory string, and there was one — it was
 * a mistake.** Until 2026-08-13 a declining host could supply a `reason` that
 * this module relayed "to the UI verbatim", with an English default
 * (`NO_SERVICE_REASON`) when nothing did. Removed, on two counts:
 *
 *   1. **Wrong audience.** A visitor has no stake in which services an operator
 *      provisioned. "Submissions are not enabled for this site" reports someone's
 *      billing state to the public and reads like a breakage. It is neither — it
 *      is a service that was not bought, and **a generic component is supposed to
 *      be smart about that.**
 *   2. **Wrong language, unfixably.** Sites here are multilingual, or unilingual
 *      and not English. A host-supplied sentence bypasses the site's entire
 *      localization pipeline, and a canned constant in a public package cannot
 *      be translated at all. Any text a visitor should read is *site content*,
 *      which is authored and localized — never a string a service layer invents.
 *
 * ⇒ **`url` is the whole answer, and absence is a rendering decision rather
 * than a message.** No submit endpoint → render no form, or degrade to
 * something that still serves the visitor: a `mailto:` or a number the site
 * already carries in its content. No assistant → render no Ask-AI affordance.
 * Nobody is told why, because nobody visiting needs to know.
 *
 * **The site's own base.** `config.base` is where the site *lives*, not a
 * service it consumes — it is load-bearing for routing and asset URLs too. It
 * stays where it is and is an input here, not an entry.

 *     service on another origin is not the site's to relocate.
 *   - **Bare relative** (`_search`) — rooted first. This spelling is documented
 *     and in use, and `applyBasePath` alone would leave it untouched, silently
 *     producing a request relative to whatever page the visitor is on.
 *   - **Root-relative** (`/forms`) — the ordinary case.
 *
 * The join itself goes through `applyBasePath` rather than concatenation,

 * starts at the site root" is enforced, and it is idempotent — an
